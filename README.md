## General Information

I built this project to familiarise myself with TypeScript, moreover, I needed a pomodoro timer. I've attempted to use a similar architecture to [bulletproof-react](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react).

## Features

- Seperate modes; pomodoro, short break, long break
- Settings for the length of the modes
- An end sound with adjustable volume
- Auto continue option
- Long break occurs after a set amount of pomodoro's
- Edit the remaining time
- Skip the current pomodoro, short break, or long break

## Setup

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Run `npm start`.
